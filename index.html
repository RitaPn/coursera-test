                    Bellis perennis, the daisy, is a common European species of the family Asteraceae,
                    often considered the archetypal species of that name.
                    To distinguish this species from other "daisies" it is sometimes
                    qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy.

                    climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.
