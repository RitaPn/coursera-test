                    Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 2–6 ft (60–180 cm).
                    They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation.
                    In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which
                    numerous
                    small bulbs are found.
                    Some species develop stolons. Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species
                    form
                    bulbs near the soil surface.
                    Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the
                    soil,
                    and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the
                    soil.
                    These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb.
                    Lily, petal
                    The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites,
                    yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The
                    plants
                    are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of
                    the
                    stem, with six tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a
                    "Turk's cap". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each
                    flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the anthers. The
                    fruit
                    is a three-celled capsule.[3]
                    stamen of lilium
                    Seeds ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex germination patterns,
                    many adapted to cool temperate climates.
                    Most cool temperate species are deciduous and dormant in winter in their native environment.
                    But
                    a few species native to areas with hot summers and mild winters (Lilium candidum, Lilium
                    catesbaei, Lilium longiflorum) lose their leaves and enter a short dormant period in summer
                    or
                    autumn, sprout from autumn to winter, forming dwarf stems bearing a basal rosette of leaves
                    until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming
                    weather.

                <div class="text">
                    The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres
                    (2.0
                    to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets
                    usually
                    have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most
                    roses
                    are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
                    The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which
                    usually
                    has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink,
                    though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of
                    some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and
                    appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior
                    ovaries
                    that develop into achenes.[3] Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.
                    The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the
                    domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do
                    not
                    provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa
                    pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer,
                    the
                    hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called
                    achenes)
                    embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the
                    dog
                    rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the
                    richest
                    sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and
                    waxwings,
                    which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat
                    the
                    seeds.
                    The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically
                    prickles,
                    outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns,
                    which
                    are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in
                    hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and
                    Rosa
                    pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce
                    browsing
                    by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion
                    and
                    protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite
                    the
                    presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only
                    vestigial prickles that have no points.

                    Bellis perennis generally blooms from early to midsummer, although when grown under ideal
                    conditions, it has a very long flowering season and will even produce a few flowers in the
                    middle of mild winters.[6][7]
                    It can generally be grown in USDA Zones 4 – 8 (i.e. where minimum temperatures are above −30
                    °F
                    (−34 °C)) in full sun to partial shade conditions, and requires low or no maintenance. It
                    has no
                    known serious insect or disease problems and can generally be grown in most well-drained
                    soils.
                    The plant may be propagated either by seed after the last frost, or by division after
                    flowering.[6][8]
                    Though not native to the United States,[9] the species is still considered a valuable ground
                    cover in certain garden settings (e.g., as part of English or cottage inspired gardens, as
                    well
                    as spring meadows where low growth and some color is desired in parallel with minimal care
                    and
                    maintenance while helping to crowd out noxious weeds once established and naturalised).
                    Numerous single- and double-flowered varieties are in cultivation, producing flat or
                    spherical
                    blooms in a range of sizes (1 cm to 6 cm) and colours (red, pink & white). They are
                    generally
                    grown from seed as biennial bedding plants. They can also be purchased as plugs in Spring.
                    It has been reported to be mostly self-fertilizing, but some plants may be self-sterile.[10]
